Hi. I'm Vamshi Kumar Kurva, an AI-ML enthusiast. I'm currently working as Data Scientist at FireEye labs, Bangalore. I'm a master's graduate in [Machine Learning and Computing](https://www.iist.ac.in/departments/mathematics-academics) specialization from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/). I also hold bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Sree Nidhi Institute of Science and Technology. I started out this website to write and share blogs on basic maths and novel ML methodologies and algorithms.
