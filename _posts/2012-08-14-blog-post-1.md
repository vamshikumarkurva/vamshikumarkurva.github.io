This blog post talks about latent variables, why we need them and how to train latent variable models.

Latent Variables
======

Latent variable is a variable which is never observed (hidden). Why do we need them?
1. Our data might contain missing values
2. We want to know about the uncertainty in our predictions.
Assume you are an HR in a company, and you want to call eligible candidates for interview. Also assume that thevariables for consideration are somethings like GPA, IQ score, Aptitude test score, high school grade etc. Not allcandidates might have taken all the tests, and hence data might contain missing values. Also, we want to quantifyuncertainty in our predictions, so that we can make better decisions about whom to invite for interview. For example,if a candidate is predicted to be a not good fit for the interview, but with high uncertainty, we may as well invitehim for the interview since we are not sure he is not a good fit. To handle these kinds of data we need probabilisticmodels.

Probabilistic model
======

Suppose $$X_1, X_2, X_3$$ are random variables that depends on one another. Now letâ€™s assume each of them taken on one of 100, 200, 300 values respectively. So, the total no of combinations of all variables are 6 million. We can model the joint probability distribution as

Aren't headings cool?
