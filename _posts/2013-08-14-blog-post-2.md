This blog post talks about Bayesian view of statistics and the need for variatinal inference and a simple Mean Field approximation method

Bayesian view of statistics
======

Traditional ML methods treats model parameters as constants, and tries to find them using maximum likelihood principle. Here the model parameters $\theta$ are just unknown, not random. This view of $\theta$ as being constant, but unknown value is taken in frequentist statistics. An alternate approach to parameter estimation is Bayesian view which treats model parameters as random variables with unknown values. The following can be considered as main ideas of Bayesian view. \
1. Use prior knowledge \
2. Choose answers that explains the observations mostly \
3. Avoid making extra assumptions (Occam's razor)

Baye's Theorem 
------

Let $$\theta$$ --> parameters, $$X$$ --> observations

$$
    \underbrace{p(\theta/X)}_{Posterior} = \frac{\overbrace{p(X/\theta)}^{Likelihood}\overbrace{p(\theta)}^{Prior}}{\underbrace{p(X)}_{Evidence}}
$$

In the above formulae,\
$$p(\theta)$$ --> prior information that we have on parameters \
$$p(X/\theta)$$ --> Likelihood (How well our params explains observations) \
$$p(\theta/X)$$ --> Posterior (How well the data explains the params)\
$$p(X)$$ ---> Evidence (How likely to observe the given data, can only be calculated if we have a model that can generate the data)

Bayesian methods tries to find the distribution over the model parameters, after observing the data (posterior). In case of 

Training
------

$$
    p(\theta/ X_{tr}, y_{tr}) = \frac{p(y_{tr}/X_{tr}, \theta) p(\theta)}{p(y_{tr}/X_{tr})}
$$

Inference
------

$$
    p(y_{ts}/X_{ts}, X_{tr}, y_{tr}) = \int_{\theta} p(y_{ts}/X_{ts}, \theta) p(\theta/ X_{tr}, y_{tr}) d\theta
$$

By choosing a proper prior, we can embed our prior knowledge into the model and hence prior can be used as a regularizer. Bayes theorem can also be used for online training.

$$
   \underbrace{p_k(\theta)}_{New prior} =  \underbrace{p(\theta/x_k)}_{Posterior} = \frac{\overbrace{p(x_k/\theta)}^{Likelihood}\overbrace{p_{k-1}(\theta)}^{Prior}}{\underbrace{p(x_k)}_{Evidence}}
$$

On every iteration, we get new data and we use the posterior from the previous iteration as prior for the current iteration. Our posterior becomes more and more accurate with the incoming evidence over iterations.

Analytical Inference
------

The denominator in the Baye's theorem is the evidence term $$p(X)$$ is difficult to model, so calculating posterior distribution in closed form is not possible. Therefore, we approximate the posterior in general. One common approach is to replace the posterior with a single point estimate. The MAP (Maximu A Posteriori) estimate of $$\theta$$ is given by


\\[
\begin{aligned}
    \theta_{MAP} &= \argmax_{\theta} p(\theta/X) \\
                 &= \argmax_{\theta} p(X/\theta) p(\theta)
\end{aligned}
\\]


Conjugate distributions
------

Prior $$p(\theta)$$ is conjugate to the likelihood $P(X/\theta)$ if the posterior and prior lies in the same family of distributions.
For example, let both prior and likelihood are normal distributions with $$p(\theta) = \mathcal{N}(\theta/m,s^2)$$ and $$p(X/\theta) = \mathcal{N}(X/\theta, \sigma^2)$$

$$
    \underbrace{p(\theta/X)}_{\mathcal{N}(a, b^2)} = \frac{\overbrace{p(X/\theta)}^{\mathcal{N}(X/\theta, \sigma^2)}\overbrace{p(\theta)}^{\mathcal{N}(\theta/m, s^2)}}{p(X)}
$$

i.e. if we choose prior that's conjugate to the likelihood, we can avoid computing the evidence, since the posterior belongs to the prior family of distributions.

Let the likelihood be Bernouli, and prior be beta, then

\\[
\begin{aligned}
    p(X/\theta) &= \theta^{N_1}(1-\theta)^{N_0} \\
    p(\theta) &= \math{B}(\theta/a,b) \propto \thata^{a-1} (1-\theta)^{b-1} \\
    p(\theta/X) &\propto p(X/\theta) p(\theta) \\
                &\propto \theta^{N_1+a-1} (1-\theta)^{N_0+b-1} \\
                &= \math{B}(N_1+a, N_0+b)
\end{aligned}
\\]

i.e we calculated the exact posterior without calculating the evidence.
