This blogpost talks about linear transformation and geometric intuitions of matrices, change of basis, eigen decomposition and singular value decomposition.

Linear mapping
------
Vectors are objects that can added together multiplied by a scalar and the resulting object is still a vector. Consider two vector spaces $$v, W$$. A mapping $$ \phi : V \rightarrow W$$ preserves the structure of vector space if for all $$x,y \in V$$ and $$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$$.

\\[
\begin{aligned}
    \phi(x+y) &= \phi(x) + \phi(y) \\
    \phi(\alpha x) &= \alpha \phi(x)
\end{aligned}
\\]

This mapping is also called linear mapping. It can be summarized as

$$
    \forall x, y \in V, \forall \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}: \phi(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha \phi(x) + \beta \phi(y) 
$$

We can represent linear mappings/transformations as matrices. Consider a mapping $$\phi : V \rightarrow W$$, where $$V, W$$ are arbitrary sets, Then the mapping $$\phi$$ is called

1. *Injective* if $$\forall x, y \in V: \phi(x)=\phi(y) \implies x=y$$
2. *Surjective* if $\phi(V) = W$
3. *Bijective* if both injective and surjective

The following are special cases of linear mappings between vector spaces $$V$$ and $$W$$:

1. *Isomorphism* if $$\phi: V \rightarrow W$$ is linear and bijective
2. *Endomorphism* if $$\phi: V \rightarrow V$$ is linear.
3. *Automorphism* if $$\phi: V \rightarrow V$$ is linear and bijective.

Consider the vector spaces $$V, W$$ with corresponding ordered basis $$B = (b_1, b_2...b_n)$$ and $$C = (c_1, c_2...c_m)$$. Consider that $$\phi :  V \rightarrow W$$ is a linear transformation such that for $$j \in {1,2,..n}$$,

$$
    \phi (b_j) = \alpha_{1j} c_1 + \alpha_{2j} c_2 +...+ \alpha_{mj} c_j
$$

is the unique representation of $$\phi (b_j)$$ w.r.to $$C$$. We call the $$m \times n$$ matrix $$A_{\phi}$$ given by

$$
    A_{\phi}(i,j) = \alpha_{ij}
$$

as the transformation matrix of $$\phi$$ (w.r.to the ordered basis $$B$$ of $$V$$ and $$C$$ of $$W$$). If $$\hat{x}$$ is the representation of vector $$x \in V$$ w.r.to $$B$$ and $$\hat{y}$$ is the representation of $$y = \phi(x) \in W$$ w.r.to $$C$$, then

$$
    \hat{y} = A_{\phi} \hat{x}
$$
i.e. transformation matrix can be used to map coordinate vectors w.r.to an ordered basis in $$V$$ to coordinates w.r.to an ordered basis in $$W$$.

Let see how the transformation matrix changes if we change the ordered basis of $$V$$ from $$B$$ to $$\Tilde{B}$$ and the ordered basis of $$W$$ from $$C$$ to $$\Tilde{C}$$. Let $$\hat{A_{\phi}}$$ be the transformation matrix w.r.to the new basis, i.e.

$$
    \Tilde{y} = \hat{A_{\phi}} \Tilde{x} \label{eq5}
$$

$$\Tilde{y}, \Tilde{x}$$ are the representations of $$\hat{y}, \hat{x}$$ w.r.to new basis of $$W, V$$. Therefore
