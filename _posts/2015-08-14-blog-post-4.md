This blogpost talks about linear transformation and geometric intuitions of matrices, change of basis, eigen decomposition and singular value decomposition.

Linear mapping
------
Vectors are objects that can added together multiplied by a scalar and the resulting object is still a vector. Consider two vector spaces $$v, W$$. A mapping $$ \phi : V \rightarrow W$$ preserves the structure of vector space if for all $$x,y \in V$$ and $$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$$.

\\[
\begin{aligned}
    \phi(x+y) &= \phi(x) + \phi(y) \\
    \phi(\alpha x) &= \alpha \phi(x)
\end{aligned}
\\]

This mapping is also called linear mapping. It can be summarized as

$$
    \forall x, y \in V, \forall \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}: \phi(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha \phi(x) + \beta \phi(y) 
$$

We can represent linear mappings/transformations as matrices. Consider a mapping $$\phi : V \rightarrow W$$, where $$V, W$$ are arbitrary sets, Then the mapping $$\phi$$ is called

1. *Injective* if $$\forall x, y \in V: \phi(x)=\phi(y) \implies x=y$$
2. *Surjective* if $\phi(V) = W$
3. *Bijective* if both injective and surjective

The following are special cases of linear mappings between vector spaces $$V$$ and $$W$$:

1. *Isomorphism* if $$\phi: V \rightarrow W$$ is linear and bijective
2. *Endomorphism* if $$\phi: V \rightarrow V$$ is linear.
3. *Automorphism* if $$\phi: V \rightarrow V$$ is linear and bijective.

Consider the vector spaces $$V, W$$ with corresponding ordered basis $$B = (b_1, b_2...b_n)$$ and $$C = (c_1, c_2...c_m)$$. Consider that $$\phi :  V \rightarrow W$$ is a linear transformation such that for $$j \in {1,2,..n}$$,

$$
    \phi (b_j) = \alpha_{1j} c_1 + \alpha_{2j} c_2 +...+ \alpha_{mj} c_j
$$

is the unique representation of $$\phi (b_j)$$ w.r.to $$C$$. We call the $$m \times n$$ matrix $$A_{\phi}$$ given by

$$
    A_{\phi}(i,j) = \alpha_{ij}
$$

as the transformation matrix of $$\phi$$ (w.r.to the ordered basis $$B$$ of $$V$$ and $$C$$ of $$W$$). If $$\hat{x}$$ is the representation of vector $$x \in V$$ w.r.to $$B$$ and $$\hat{y}$$ is the representation of $$y = \phi(x) \in W$$ w.r.to $$C$$, then

$$
    \hat{y} = A_{\phi} \hat{x}
$$
i.e. transformation matrix can be used to map coordinate vectors w.r.to an ordered basis in $$V$$ to coordinates w.r.to an ordered basis in $$W$$.

Let see how the transformation matrix changes if we change the ordered basis of $$V$$ from $$B$$ to $$B_1$$ and the ordered basis of $$W$$ from $$C$$ to $$C_1$$. Let $$\hat{A_{\phi}}$$ be the transformation matrix w.r.to the new basis, i.e.

$$
    y_1 = \hat{A_{\phi}} x_1 \label{eq5}
$$

$$y_1, x_1$$ are the representations of $$\hat{y}, \hat{x}$$ w.r.to new basis of $$W, V$$. Therefore

\\[
\begin{aligned}
    C_1 y_1 &= C\hat{y} \implies \hat{y} = \underbrace{C^{-1}C_1}_{T}y_1 \label{eq3}\newline
    B_1 x_1 &= B\hat{x} \implies \hat{x} = \underbrace{B^{-1}\B_1}_{S}x_1 \label{eq4}
\end{aligned}
\\]

substituting (\ref{eq3}), (\ref{eq4}) in (\ref{eq5})

\\[
\begin{aligned}
    T\hat{y} &= A_{\phi} S \hat{x} \newline
    \hat{y} &= T^{-1}A_{\phi}S \hat{x} \label{eq6}
\end{aligned}
\\]

comparing (\ref{eq5}) and (\ref{eq6})

$$
    \hat{A_{\phi}} = T^{-1}A_{\phi}S
$$

Here, 
$$S \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$ is the transformation matrix of $$id_V$$ that maps coordinates with respect to $$B_1$$ onto coordinates with respect to B and $$T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$$ is the transformation matrix of $$id_W$$ that maps coordinates with respect to $$C_1$$ onto coordinates with respect to C.

The transformation matrix $$ \hat{A_{\phi}} $$ can be interpreted as follows: First, transform coordinates w.r.to $$B_1$$ onto $$B$$.Then, use transformation matrix to map coordinates onto vector space $$W$$ w.r.to $$C$$. Finally, map the coordinates onto $$C_1$$ from $$C$$.  If we  write down all the linear transformations, then $$A_{\phi}:B \rightarrow C, \hat{A_{\phi}}: B_1 \rightarrow C_1, S:B_1 \rightarrow B, T: C_1 \rightarrow C$ and $T^{-1}: C \rightarrow C_1$,

\\[
\begin{aligned}
    B_1 \rightarrow C_1 &= B_1 \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow C_1 \newline
    \hat{A_{\phi}} &= T^{-1} A_{\phi} S
\end{aligned} 
\\]

The matrices/linear mappings $$A_{\phi}$$ and $$\hat{A_{\phi}}$$ are called equivalent matrices, since they correspond to the same linear mapping, but w.r.to different basis.

Similar matrices
------

Two matrices $$A, \Tilde{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$ are similar, if there exists a matrix $$S$$, such that $$\Tilde{A} = S^{-1}AS$$. Similar matrices correspond to the same automorphism w.r.to different basis. Similar matrices are always equivalent, however equivalent matrices are not necessarily similar.

*Remark*: Eigen value analysis can be used to characterize a matrix and it's associated linear mappings. Similar matrices have the same eigen values. Therefore, a linear mapping $$\phi$$ has eigenvalues that are independent of the choice of basis of its transformation matrix. This makes eigenvalues, together with the determinant and the trace, key characteristic parameters of a linear mapping as they are all invariant under basis change.
