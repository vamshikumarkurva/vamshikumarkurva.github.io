title: "Force control for robust quadruped locomotion: A linear policy approach"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Force_Control_ICRA_2023
excerpt: 'In this work, we proposed a computationally efficient
control architecture consisting of a linear policy and a QP
that can achieve stable and robust locomotion and handle
external disturbances. We showed that our policy achieved
zero-shot generalization to commanded velocities from the
joystick and helped in direction-controlled walking for realworld applications'
