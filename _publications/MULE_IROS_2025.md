title: "MULE: Multi-terrain and Unknown Load Adaptation for Effective Quadrupedal Locomotion"
collection: publications
permalink: 'https://www.stochlab.com/MULE/'
excerpt: 'We propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. 
The framework consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and improve command tracking under payload variations. 
We validate the proposed approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped.'
