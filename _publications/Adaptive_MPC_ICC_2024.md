excerpt: 'In this work, we presented a force-based controller capable of adapting to changes in load conditions. We employed
a system identification technique to identify changing parameters of interest using data collected from the base controller in real-time. We validated our controller in PyBullet simulator under two different test conditions, demonstrating superior command tracking compared to the base controller.'
